   <h3>Change, Growth, Empowerment</h3>
	<p>...are a few things that I have been focusing on myself lately. This is a reason why I am in this class.
        I am originally from Indiana. I have lived in California for almost a decade. Upon moving here I received my degree in Computer
        Networking and throughout my years here it has not been of much help in my "growth". I now have a 2 year old son. Growing up I never wanted
        kids, and yes he was planned haha. This is a part of my "change". He means everything to me now and I want to grow as a human
        to make his life as best as it can be. I can't wait for the day of my graduation to prove my worth to the world as a programmer. I hope that having
        my son see me doing homework and diligently working to be a good daddy, student and husband will show him the meaning of success during his childhood.
        At the end of the day, I will celebrate my power and my worth.
    </p>
